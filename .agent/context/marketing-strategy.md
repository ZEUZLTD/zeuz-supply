# Marketing Strategy & Brand Voice

## 1. Brand Identity: "Industrial High-Fidelity"
ZEUZ is **not** a dropshipping store. ZEUZ is a **technical protocol** for energy infrastructure.

### The "Teenage Engineering" Vibe
*   **Tone**: Clinical, Precise, Minimalist, Confident.
*   **Avoid**: Marketing fluff ("Buy now!", "Best deals!", "Amazing Battery!").
*   **Use**: Technical specifications ("Discharge Rate: 45A", "Internal Resistance: <12mΩ").
*   **Visual Logic**: The website should feel like a dashboard or a multimeter, not a shopping cart.

### Key Manifestos
*   "ZEUZ_SUPPLY is not a storefront. It is a technical protocol."
*   "Zero-Trust Inventory Model."
*   "The Infrastructure of Power."
